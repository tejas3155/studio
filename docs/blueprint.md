# **App Name**: CoperVise: AI Executive Assistant

## Core Features:

- Notion-Like Interface: Mimic Notion's core UI/UX, including a flexible block-based editor, drag-and-drop functionality, and intuitive page organization. Every feature and visual element seen on Notion's landing page should be replicated.
- User Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization following Notion's model, including email/password login, social logins, and secure session management.
- AI-Powered Assistance: Integrate an AI "tool" to provide executive assistant functions, such as smart summaries, task prioritization suggestions, and intelligent content suggestions. Focus the AI towards enhancing productivity and decision-making, while adapting the content structure to that of a knowledge base.
- Template Library: Offer a range of customizable templates for different use cases (project management, meeting notes, personal organization, etc.) to accelerate user onboarding and provide a starting point for content creation.
- Real-time Collaboration: Enable real-time collaboration features with version control to facilitate team work. Provide appropriate sharing options that Notion users enjoy, and which are consistent with secure usage.
- Search: Offer full text search with extensive content filtering (by creation date, author, included users). Ensure very rapid searching, even for long and obscure snippets of text.
- Import/Export: Enable full import/export capabilities (markdowm, PDF) so users can transition from existing software platforms.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark grayish blue (#5C6B7A) to maintain a professional and focused aesthetic, evoking feelings of competence, reliability, and sophistication.
- Background color: Very light grayish blue (#F0F4F7), close in hue to the primary, providing a neutral, clean, and distraction-free canvas for content creation.
- Accent color: Muted blue-purple (#7A64A8), offering subtle visual interest, ideal for interactive elements and CTAs without overwhelming the interface.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for a modern and neutral look, optimized for readability on screens.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a geometric sans-serif font to create a bold but techy feeling
- Use a set of minimalist and consistent icons that clearly represent actions and content types, aligned with Notion's style.
- Maintain a clean, spacious layout that minimizes visual clutter and allows users to focus on their content.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience and provide feedback on interactions, while keeping the interface responsive and snappy.
